# Reflection-Removal
This project was done as the course project for the Digital Image Processing course and was mentored by Prof. Avinash Sharma. I developed a matlab implementation of the paper “Reflection removal using ghosting cues” by YiChang et al. It includes Reflection Removal using Ghosting Cues and Patch Priors which is modeled as a half Quadratic Optimization Problem.
